# Boston Crime Analysis
This is my Capstone Project for Analytics Systems Technology

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Business Requirements/Understanding

1. What are the top offenses committed in the city?
2. Are certain crimes committed during a specific time period?
3. Does geography play a role in particular crimes being committed?
4. Has crime decreased or increased over time?
    * What types of offenses remain relevant (status-quo)
    * Newer crimes being committed 
    * Has a specific occurrence of a particular offense decreased over time?
5. Can we determine high-risk areas based on a set of features?

I plan to utilize the [CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) process model for this project:
1.    Business understanding – What does the business need?
2.    Data understanding – What data do we have/need? Is it clean?
3.    Data preparation – How do we organize the data for modeling?
4.    Modeling – What modeling techniques should we apply?
5.    Evaluation – Which model best meets the business objectives?
6.    Deployment – How do stakeholders access the results?

## Project Description
As a lifelong Boston resident, I wanted to learn more about crimes committed within Boston. Thankfully, the Boston Police Department (BPD) provides incident reporting data for public use. 
I have collected several datasets from https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system starting from 2017-2021.  Moreover, the datasets are comprised of records from the new crime incident reporting system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident and when and where it occurred. 


#### Total sample size (n=314597)

Size Breakdown
* 2017(n=101338)  
* 2018(n=98888)
* 2020(n=70894)
* both 2019 (n=19782 | Sep-Dec) and 2021 (n=23695 | Jan - May) are partial years. 
 
**Total size: 54.5 MB**
