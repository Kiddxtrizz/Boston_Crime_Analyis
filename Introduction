### Introduction

As a lifelong resident of Boston, I am curious about the crimes committed within the city. Thankfully, the data provided by the city can give me a glimpse of Boston's underbelly. I hope to understand better what crimes are being reported more often than others and where the town is happening.   I have collected several datasets from https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system. Although, the available data starts in 2015, I will be using data from 2017 - 2021 with a total sample size of n=314597; both 2019 (n=19782 | Sep - Dec) and 2021 (n=23695 | Jan - May) are partial years.  

Sample Space:
* 2017, n=101338
* 2018, n=98888
* 2020, n=70894

**Business Requirements/Understanding:**

1. What are top offenses committed in the city?
2. Are certain crimes committed during a specific time-period?
3. Does geography play a role in particular crimes being commited?
4. Has crime decreased or increased over time?
    * What types of offesens remain relevant (stats-quo)
    * Newer crimes being committed 
    * Has a specific occurence of a particular offense decreased over time?
5. Can we determine high risk areas based on a set of features?

**Overview:**

I plan to utilize the [CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) process model for this project:
1.    Business understanding – What does the business need?
2.    Data understanding – What data do we have / need? Is it clean?
3.    Data preparation – How do we organize the data for modeling?
4.    Modeling – What modeling techniques should we apply?
5.    Evaluation – Which model best meets the business objectives?
6.    Deployment – How do stakeholders access the results?
